			<h1>Welcom to Dog Identification Service!</h1>
		</div>

		<h2>What is this website?</h2>
		Dog Identification Service is an example project that uses django and trained pytorch model to allow the user to identify the dog in an image. 
		The image can be uploaded by the user and the model will identify the dog in the image.

		<h2>How to use this web service?</h2>
		The detailed instructions can be found in <a href="/about/">About</a> subpage

		<h2>About the model</h2>
		
		The trained model achieved accurracy of 84% on the validation data that is data that the model did not see during the training of the model, 
		this resulted in robust identification capabilitied for the 120 breeds that are within 
		the <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/">Stanford Dog Dataset</a>.
		<br>

		<p class="infobox">
			The model used for the app has been trained on the <a href="http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/">Stanford Dog Dataset</a> which is a collection of 20580 images of different dogs of 120 breeds. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The model bases on residual network <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">ResNet152</a> architecture. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The model was trained PyTorch package for Python using transfer learning approach 
			basing on the resnet model trained on image net while training layer3 and layer 4 of the networks with different learning rates.

		<h2>List of dog breeds that the model was trained on</h2>
			<div class="item-box">
				{% for dog_breed in dog_breeds %}
					<div class="item-box-el">{{ dog_breed }}</div>
				{% endfor %}
			</div>
		{% endif %}
		<h2>What if you dog's breed is not on the list?</h2>
		Then it will most likely be classified as a dog breed that looks similar to your dog's breed, we invite you to submit your photo using the feedback form then so that in the future a new model can be developed that includes your dog's breed.
